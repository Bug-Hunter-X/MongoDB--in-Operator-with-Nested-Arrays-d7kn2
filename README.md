# MongoDB $in Operator with Nested Arrays

This example demonstrates an uncommon error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with nested arrays.  The `$in` operator is designed to match a single field against multiple values.  When provided with an array of arrays, it performs the match unexpectedly.

The `bug.js` file contains the incorrect query, while `bugSolution.js` shows the correct approach using the `$or` operator for achieving the desired matching behavior.

This is a subtle error that may occur for developers unfamiliar with the detailed behavior of MongoDB operators, especially when dealing with complex data structures.
